Air pollution kills 7 million people annually. The brick kiln sector significantly contributes to economic development but also accounts for 8-14% of air pollution in India. 

This work demonstrates the first scalable automated approach for brick kiln monitoring using free satellite imagery, enabling policy-makers to monitor compliance at unprecedented scale across the Indo-Gangetic Plain.
