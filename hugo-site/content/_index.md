## Abstract

Air pollution kills 7 million people annually. The brick kiln sector significantly contributes to economic development but also accounts for 8-14% of air pollution in India. Policymakers have implemented compliance measures to regulate brick kilns. Emission inventories are critical for air quality modeling and source apportionment studies.

## Key Statistics

- **Total Kilns Detected**: 30,638
- **Model Accuracy (mAP)**: 0.71  
- **Population Area Covered**: 448 million people
- **Violation Rate**: 70% of detected kilns show compliance issues
