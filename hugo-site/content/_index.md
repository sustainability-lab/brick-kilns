## Key Findings

- **Total Kilns Detected**: 30,638 across five Indo-Gangetic states
- **Model Accuracy (mAP)**: 0.71 using YOLOv11m-OBB
- **Population Coverage**: 448 million people in analyzed regions  
- **Compliance Violations**: 70% of detected kilns violate distance-based rules
- **Health Impact**: 30.66 million people live within 800m of brick kilns
- **Air Pollution**: Brick kilns contribute ~8% to PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ in Delhi

## Research Impact

This work demonstrates the first scalable automated approach for brick kiln monitoring using free satellite imagery, directly supporting:

- **UN SDG 3**: Reducing air pollution health impacts
- **UN SDG 11**: Monitoring urban air quality  
- **UN SDG 13**: Tracking greenhouse gas emissions
- **Policy Implementation**: Automated compliance monitoring at scale
