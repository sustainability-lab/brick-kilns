## Automatic Compliance Monitoring

We applied various big data resources for automated compliance monitoring, focusing on two types of compliance rules: distance-based and technology-based.

## Distance-Based Compliance Analysis

Using OpenStreetMap data across 13 categories, our analysis revealed that **70% of brick kilns violate at least one rule**. The government regulations require:

- Minimum 800 meters distance from residential areas and fruit orchards
- Minimum 1 km distance between two brick kilns
- Specific setbacks from schools, hospitals, highways, and water bodies

**Table 5: Automatic compliance detection of brick kilns in various states**
*More than 70% of brick kilns violate at least one compliance rule. '-' indicates policy not defined for that state.*

| Criterion | Uttar Pradesh | Bihar | West Bengal | Haryana | Punjab | Total |
|-----------|---------------|-------|-------------|---------|--------|-------|
| Inter kiln | 6469 | 2343 | 669 | 1035 | 604 | 11120 |
| Hospital | 6741 | 656 | 1271 | 176 | - | 8844 |
| Habitation | 5765 | 1471 | 362 | 131 | 327 | 8056 |
| National Highway | 1495 | 579 | 128 | - | - | 2202 |
| River | - | 1029 | 338 | - | - | 1367 |
| **Non-compliant kilns** | **12145** | **4234** | **2173** | **1453** | **1455** | **21460** |

## Technology-Based Compliance

For technology-based compliance, we examined trends in brick kiln technologies over 12 years between 2017 and 2021. Our findings indicate:

- Gradual adoption of cleaner Zigzag kiln technology
- Regional variations in technology compliance
- Policy impact on technology upgrades in Delhi airshed

## Population Impact Analysis

Our analysis determined that **30.66 million people live within 800 meters of brick kilns**, violating central government regulations. This highlights the significant population exposure to brick kiln emissions.

## Air Quality Impact

Our findings indicate that brick kilns contribute approximately **8% to PM₂.₅ concentrations in Delhi**. This substantial contribution underscores the need for effective compliance monitoring and enforcement.

## Policy Implications

The compliance analysis supports:
- Targeted enforcement in high-violation areas
- Technology upgrade incentives for non-compliant kilns
- Enhanced monitoring of population exposure
- Evidence-based policy refinement and implementation
