## Air Pollution Impact

Air pollution kills **7 million people annually** worldwide. In India, the brick kiln sector significantly contributes to this burden, accounting for **8-14% of the country's air pollution**.

## Population Exposure Analysis

Our analysis covers regions with **448 million population**, providing critical data for:

- Air quality modeling and health impact assessment
- Population exposure mapping
- Environmental justice analysis
- Policy impact evaluation

## Health Effects of Brick Kiln Emissions

Brick kiln emissions contribute to various health problems:

- **Respiratory diseases**: PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀ emissions cause breathing difficulties
- **Cardiovascular effects**: Fine particulates increase heart disease risk
- **Premature mortality**: Contributing to the 7 million annual air pollution deaths
- **Vulnerable populations**: Children and elderly face higher risks

**Table 6: Emission rates for kiln technologies in g/kg of fired brick product**

| Pollutant | CFCBK/FCBK | Zigzag |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| PM₂.₅ | 0.18 | 0.09 |
| SO₂ | 0.52 | 0.15 |
| CO | 3.63 | 1.19 |
| CO₂ | 179.00 | 107.50 |

The data shows Zigzag kilns produce significantly lower emissions compared to traditional CFCBK/FCBK kilns, supporting the policy push for technology upgrades.

## Operational Context

Brick kilns typically operate for six months each year, from 15th November to 15th May in Bihar and West Bengal, and from 15th December to 15th June in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, and Haryana, based on expert inputs. We calculate daily production by dividing the annual production by 180 days. We estimate emissions in tonnes per day for each state by combining emission rates (g/kg) for each technology with the mass of bricks produced (kg).

**Table 7: Production of brick kilns and Emissions (tonnes per day) in various states**

| State | Mass | PM₂.₅ | SO₂ | CO | CO₂ |
|-------|------|--------|------|-----|------|
| Uttar Pradesh | 794816.67 | 118.51 | 312.33 | 2219.30 | 122759.72 |
| Bihar | 401661.11 | 45.86 | 100.15 | 741.14 | 50890.09 |
| West Bengal | 321627.78 | 39.56 | 91.86 | 670.36 | 43003.29 |
| Haryana | 124283.33 | 11.89 | 21.54 | 167.01 | 13920.39 |
| Punjab | 99488.89 | 10.27 | 20.34 | 154.14 | 11742.67 |
| **Total** | **1741877.78** | **226.08** | **546.23** | **3951.95** | **242316.16** |

## PM₂.₅ Concentration Analysis

Our findings indicate that brick kilns contribute approximately **8% to PM₂.₅ concentrations in Delhi**. This represents a significant portion of the total air pollution burden in one of the world's most polluted cities.

## Regional Health Impact

The health impact varies across regions:

- **Delhi NCR**: Highest concentration and health risk
- **Indo-Gangetic Plain**: Large population exposure across rural areas  
- **Industrial corridors**: Combined industrial and brick kiln pollution
- **Seasonal variations**: Higher impacts during peak operational periods

## UN Sustainable Development Goals

Our research directly supports several UN SDGs:

- **SDG 3.4 & 3.9**: Addressing premature deaths from air pollution
- **SDG 11.6**: Monitoring PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀ emissions in cities
- **SDG 13.2**: Tracking greenhouse gas emissions from brick production

**Table 8: Population (in millions) living within 0.8 km, 2 km, and 5 km of brick kilns across five states in the Indo-Gangetic Plain**

| State | < 0.8 km | < 2 km | < 5 km |
|-------|----------|--------|---------|
| Uttar Pradesh | 13.81 | 63.32 | 168.83 |
| Bihar | 9.43 | 44.22 | 98.41 |
| West Bengal | 4.35 | 18.54 | 50.47 |
| Haryana | 1.12 | 6.34 | 19.36 |
| Punjab | 1.95 | 10.03 | 25.64 |
| **Total** | **30.66** | **142.45** | **362.71** |

This analysis shows that **30.66 million people** live within 0.8 km of brick kilns, with the number increasing to **362.71 million** within 5 km. This highlights the urgent need for targeted health interventions and cleaner kiln technologies.

## Policy Context and Population Exposure

According to central government policy, brick kilns must be at least 800 meters away from human habitation. However, more than 30 million people live within this range of brick kilns. Our analysis highlights the need for targeted studies to assess the health impacts of this proximity and evaluate interventions, such as relocating kilns or adopting cleaner technologies, to mitigate risks.

## Policy Recommendations for Health Protection

1. **Strengthened air quality monitoring** near brick kiln clusters
2. **Health impact assessments** for new kiln installations
3. **Technology mandates** for cleaner production methods
4. **Population health surveillance** in high-exposure areas
