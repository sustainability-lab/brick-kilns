## Brick Kilns

A brick kiln is a facility where bricks are produced through shaping, drying, firing, and cooling processes. The brick-making process involves four main steps: shaping, drying, firing, and exporting. Brick kilns are often located near rivers due to the availability of suitable soil.

## Continuous Fire Brick Kilns

Brick kilns are classified into batch production kilns and continuous fire kilns. Continuous fire kilns are more energy-efficient as they reuse warm air from the combustion zone to dry unfired bricks. In India, approximately 75% of bricks are produced by continuous fire kilns, with FCBK and Zigzag kilns being the most common types.

## Brick Kilns and Sustainability

### Air Pollution

In 2017, India's total brick production was estimated at 233±15 billion bricks, consuming 990±125 PJ yr⁻¹ of energy. Brick kilns contribute an estimated 8-14% of India's air pollution. Advanced technologies, such as Zigzag kilns, reduce PM and CO emissions by approximately 60-70%.

### United Nations Sustainable Development Goals

Brick production relies heavily on labor, employing approximately 15 million workers in India. This raises concerns related to forced labor, modern slavery, and human trafficking, which are addressed by UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8.7. Our research intersects with several SDGs, including addressing premature deaths from air pollution (SDG 3.4 & 3.9), mitigating CO₂ emissions (SDG 9.4), monitoring PM2.5 and PM10 emissions (SDG 11.6), reducing fossil-fuel subsidies (SDG 12.c), and tracking greenhouse gas emissions (SDG 13.2).

## Government Policies

The National Clean Air Program (NCAP), launched in 2019, aims to reduce air pollution levels to comply with National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The Environment (Protection) Amendment Rules, 2022, mandated the conversion of all brick kilns within 10 km of non-attainment cities to cleaner technologies by 2024. Brick kilns must be located at least 800 meters from residential areas and fruit orchards, and a minimum distance of 1 km must be maintained between two brick kilns.

## Object Detection Models

Object detection involves identifying objects in an image by predicting their bounding boxes and classifying them into predefined categories. Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBBs) offer a more precise representation of object areas, especially for irregularly oriented objects. In the context of brick kilns, OBBs facilitate accurate spatial extent estimation, which is essential for assessing brick production capacity and calculating emission factors for air quality modeling.
