# Results

Our analysis reveals significant insights about brick kiln distribution and environmental compliance across the studied regions.

## Key Findings

### Detection Performance
- **Total Kilns Detected**: 30,638
- **Model Accuracy (mAP)**: 0.71
- **Population Area Covered**: 448 million people

### Compliance Analysis
- **Violation Rate**: 70% of detected kilns show compliance issues
- **Geographic Distribution**: Concentrated in industrial regions
- **Environmental Impact**: Significant contribution to local air quality issues

## Regional Analysis

The distribution of brick kilns varies significantly across different states and regions, with higher concentrations in areas with:
- Dense industrial activity
- Proximity to urban centers
- Available raw materials

## Environmental Impact

Our findings indicate that the brick kiln sector:
- Accounts for 8-14% of air pollution in India
- Significantly impacts air quality in surrounding areas
- Requires enhanced monitoring and compliance enforcement

## Future Work

Continued monitoring and analysis will focus on:
- Real-time compliance tracking
- Seasonal variation studies
- Policy impact assessment
